# Week 4: Assumptions and Correlations

This week we will be discussing Chapters 5 and 6 from DSUR. These notes will pull out some of the important pieces from each chapter.


## Assumptions

These assumptions 


### Normally distributed data
This assumption is about the normality of the sampling distribution. The big idea here is that we tend to operate under the belief that if our _sampled_ data are normally distributed then the underlying _sampling distribution_ is also normally distributed. Also, keep in mind that this becomes less of a concern as our sample size increases (thank, Central Limit Theorem!). 

There are several tests for normality that we will discuss, which include either (a) calculations or (b) visual examination. We will discuss both.

#### Visual check of normality




### Homogeneity of variance


### Interval data


### Independence




## Correlation
